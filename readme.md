# Chapter 6
[(Heroku project)](https://nameless-hollows-66274.herokuapp.com/)

This was the chapter that I pushed my first commit on. It was fairly difficult to get to this point, as there were several discrepancies between what code worked and what code was in the book. Nevertheless, I finished up to this chapter extremely quickly and then got complacent with my lead on the work, leading to serious scheduling problems later.

The features that were implemented at this time are as follows;
* **site structure**
    * Set up basic MEAN structure
    * Set up basic routing for dynamic content
    * Dynamic page loading using the database/jade views
    * HTTP methods implemented in router
    * REST API Implemented
* **Database**
    * Implemented data models for reviews and locations
    * Set up both local and remote databases
* **Aesthetic design**
    * Jade views for the following pages
        * Home page
        * About
        * Location info
    * Added bootstrap theme
